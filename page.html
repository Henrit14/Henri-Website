    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Who am I?</h1>
    <div class="main">
    <div style="box-align: center;">
    <p>My name is Henri Tarelli, and I currently attend highschool at the Collegiate Institute of Math and Science. I am 14 years old, and I am a freshman. I attend many clubs at my school such as Young Men's Leadership, Student Government, Coding Club, and I wish to attend more in the future. I'd like to use my website to showcase my work and to showcase my skills. </p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What do I like to do?</h1>
    <div class="main">
      <div style="box-align: center;">
    <p> In my free time, I like to do many things. Some of these are playing with my computer, reading, writing, spending time with my family, going outside, and many more. I think that these things contribute to my personality, as I love to be creative and I love to be outside.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What are my interests?</h1>
        <div class="main">
          <div style="box-align: center;">
    <p>I believe that my biggest interest is a carrer that will help people. A teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, whatever that can help people throughout the world. These jobs are very important, and I believe that with my help, I can make this world a better place, one way or another.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why did I make this website?</h1>
          
            <div class="main">
              <div style="box-align: center;">
    <p>I made this website to practice on making a portfolio later when I need to apply for work. I think that this practice will assist in me finding a carrer that will land me a good job, and it's overall a great way to learn something new!</p>
